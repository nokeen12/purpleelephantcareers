                    <p>I had the pleasure of being Kelli’s immediate supervisor during her tenure at 2HB, Kelli has a solid, diverse skill set that would benefit any Marketing and Events department. In addition to her M.S. in Sports Administration and B.A. in Public Relations, Kelli brought extensive hands-on experience managing various social media platforms while working in my department. She took charge and was solely responsible for creating and executing the company's social media plan. Her ability to become fully entrenched in an organization's social media push has enabled the company to reach its social media goals. Her other duties include establishing a high school work/study program and generating the company’s online store to receive and process merchandise orders. As a direct result of Kelli's ability to think quickly and make spontaneous decisions based on good judgment, she has ensured a successful outcome on many occasions for my department. I hope to one day work with her again. </p>
